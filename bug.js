This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been assigned a value.  This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations or when a component renders before the data it needs is available.

```javascript
// Incorrect
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some-api')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')
  );
};
```

This will throw an error because `data` is initially `undefined`, and the component tries to access `data.someProperty` before the API request completes and sets the `data` state.
